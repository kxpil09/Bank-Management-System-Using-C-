# Bank Management System

This is a simple Bank Management System implemented in C++. It provides basic functionalities such as creating new accounts, updating existing accounts, checking account details, performing transactions, removing existing accounts, and exiting the program.

## Features

- **Create new account:** Allows users to create new bank accounts by providing necessary information such as name, last name, phone number, email, username, password, and initial transaction amount.

- **Update information:** Enables users to update the information of existing accounts including name, last name, phone number, email, username, password, and transaction amount.

- **Check account details:** Allows users to check the details of an existing account by providing the username.

- **Perform transactions:** Supports deposit and withdrawal transactions for existing accounts.

- **Remove existing account:** Provides options to remove an existing account either by deleting specific records or deleting all records.

- **Exit the program:** Allows users to exit the Bank Management System.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various banking operations.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Windows operating system (for `windows.h` library)

## Implementation Details

- The Bank Management System is implemented using classes and functions in C++.
- User choices are displayed using the `choice()` function.
- Operations such as creating new accounts, updating information, checking details, performing transactions, and removing accounts are implemented within the `bank` class.
- The `showdata()` function is used to display the Bank Management System title.
- The program runs in an infinite loop, allowing users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.
